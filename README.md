for the weather information on the left hand side you'll need to get a fetch url from weathapi.com, i suggest creating a "one-time-use-only" account with 10minutemail.com
you should customize the code in the following files:
 - ./script/weather.js  -> the url
 - ./script/welcome.js -> custom names and quotes
 - ./index.html -> all bookmark links and bookmark categories

 be aware that everything is optimized for firefox and a 1920x1080px display, you may have to change some css values with a bigger display
